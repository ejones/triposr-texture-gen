triposr-texture-gen
===================

![before and after images of texture gen script](media/before-after.png)

A script to generate a texture for a 3D mesh using [Stable
Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image) and
[ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet). It's designed for the outputs of
[TripoSR](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSR), an image-to-3D model by [Stability
AI](https://stability.ai/) and [Tripo AI](https://www.tripo3d.ai/), but might work on other meshes
as well. TripoSR outputs more coarse-grained textures in the form of vertex colors, so this is
helpful for (re)applying fine detail to the models.

Installation
------------

Create a virtualenv and install requirements:

```sh
python3 -m virtualenv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
-----

Run the `text2texture.py` script with the output mesh from
[TripoSR](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSR) along with a textual description of the
desired appearance. 

```sh
venv/bin/python text2texture.py ~/TripoSR/output/0/mesh.obj 'a chair that looks like an avocado'
```

The first time this runs, it will download a Stable Diffusion model (by default,
[Lykon/dreamshaper-8](https://huggingface.co/Lykon/dreamshaper-8)) and a ControlNet model. The image
model can be configured, say, to a model you've already fetched from Hugging Face.
